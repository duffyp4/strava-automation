# Strava Activity Feed

> A machine-readable feed of personal Strava activities, updated nightly. This feed is designed for consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide context for personal fitness and training data.

The primary data is located in `index.md` in this repository. Each activity is represented as a Markdown heading and a corresponding JSON-LD block conforming to the schema.org `ExerciseAction` type.

## Schema and Data
- [Activity Feed (index.md)](/index.md): The main data feed containing all scraped activities.
- [Last Processed ID (data/last_id.json)](/data/last_id.json): Contains the `activityId` of the most recently processed activity to prevent duplicates.
